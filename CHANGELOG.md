## [2.0.0] - 2019-04-15

**NOTE:** This release contains breaking changes!

### Deprecated

* ~~`--convert-system`~~ now is `--convert-systems`.
* ~~`--from-color`~~ now is `--from-ces`.
* ~~`--to-color`~~ now is `--to-ces`.

### Added

* Support for [Lars Muldjord's Skyscraper](https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/scraper#lars-muldjords-skyscraper).
* New option `--scraper` to set the scraper. Available scrapers: `sselph` and `skyscraper`.
* `--convert-systems` now accepts systems as (optional) arguments (e.g. `--convert-systems "nes snes"`).
* The script now detects the **C.E.S** of the video and if it is the same as the `from_ces` value, it won't convert the video.
* New log system. Log files are stored in `logs/`.
* Print script version with `--version`.
* Added a progress bar!

### Changed

* Search for all `.mp4` video files instead of just `-video.mp4` so the script can work with many scrapers.
